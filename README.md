# Stratoverus

Hey there! 👋

I'm Keith Eberhard, a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho and current employee at Early Warning Services with a drive for solving problems through code. My journey has taken me across a spectrum of technologies, but at my core, I’m passionate about building robust systems using **object-oriented programming** (OOP)—especially with **C++** and **C#**. I enjoy dissecting complex problems and engineering solutions that are both elegant and efficient.

## 🛠️ My Coding Toolbox

- **Languages I Love:** C++, C#, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Specialties:** Object-Oriented Programming, Software Design, Algorithms & Data Structures
- **Also Skilled At:** Web development (as a bonus), Git & GitHub, collaborative projects

## 🚀 What Drives Me

- I thrive on designing systems with clean architecture and reusable components
- I enjoy contributing to and learning from open-source OOP projects
- I believe programming is as much about creativity as it is about logic—whether I’m coding a game, crafting utilities, or automating tasks

## 🌱 Currently Exploring

- Advanced C++ patterns & memory management
- Building multi-paradigm applications in C#
- Occasionally dabbling in web tech (just for fun!)

## 🔍 Project Highlights

- **C++ Projects:** Check out my [C++ Game]([https://github.com/Stratoverus?tab=repositories&q=c%2B%2B&type=&language=](https://github.com/Stratoverus/IronBound))
- **Web Projects:** [pokecards](https://github.com/Stratoverus/pokecards)
